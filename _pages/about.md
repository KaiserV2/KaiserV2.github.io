I am Wilhelm Chen, a senior year undergraduate student majoring in computer science in Peking University. My research interests include various aspects of databases and data analysis and I hope to prolong my career in the same field. I am thankful for all the people that have helped me, especially my parents and my dear mentors Prof. [Tong Yang](http://net.pku.edu.cn/~yangtong/), Prof. [Junchen Jiang](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~junchenj/) and Prof. [Zaoxing Liu](https://zaoxing.github.io/).
