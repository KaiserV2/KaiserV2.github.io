I am Peiqing Chen, a first year PhD student in Electronic Computer Engineering department in Boston University with my advisor Prof. [Zaoxing Liu](https://zaoxing.github.io/). My research interests focus on systems and theory, especially networked systems. I am thankful for all the people that have helped me, especially my parents and my dear mentors Prof. [Tong Yang](http://net.pku.edu.cn/~yangtong/) and Prof. [Junchen Jiang](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~junchenj/).
