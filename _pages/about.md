I am a senior undergraduate student majoring computer science at Peking University. Last summer, I have carried out summer research at Carnegie Mellon University with Prof. Martial Hebert on Few-shot Learning. During my past study, I have participated in the computer vision & deep learning research in Prof. Shiliang Zhang's lab.

For the time being, I am applying for the graduate schools in USA, Canada and Europe.
